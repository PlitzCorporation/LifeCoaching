# Life Coaching by Plitz7

This project is based on Next.JS + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. All front end development and design has been created by Plitz7 and it can be used only with our authorization.

## Before Anything Else

You need to create a `.env.local` file and request to a deveper at Plitz7 the content for it. We have protected this repo for authorized developers only, if you need to make changes, please create a PR, otherwise you won't be able to submit your changes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3008](http://localhost:3008) with your browser to see the result.

Notice that the port is not `3000`, please do not change the port unless you are not hosting with us.

This project is already connected to our content management system, https://thedavid.plitz7.com. Most of text and images are through the system, verify first you can make the changes there before anything else.
